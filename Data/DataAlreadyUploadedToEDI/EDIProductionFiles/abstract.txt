Depth profiles of total and soluble iron and manganese were sampled from 2014 to 2018 in two drinking water reservoirs in southwestern Virginia, USA. These reservoirs are: Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia) and Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia). Beaverdam and Falling Creek Reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke, Virginia. The dataset consists of depth profiles of metal samples measured at the deepest site of each reservoir adjacent to the dam. Additional metal samples were collected at a gauged weir on Falling Creek Reservoirâ€™s primary inflow tributary. The samples were collected approximately fortnightly from March-April, weekly from May-October, and monthly from November-February.
